# Spotify-API-with-Spotipy
Playing with the Spotify API through the python library Spotipy 

## sync.py
Creates new playlist and populates it with all your Liked songs from Spotify.
Once it is created its will actively sync the playlist and add new liked songs

#### Future
Going forward I will add functionality for syncing with deleted songs, meaning if you unlike the song, it will be removed.

#### Bugs
As mentioned above, does not sync deleted songs, if you delete songs you will mess up syncing queue.
